  title: "I Sing the Body Electric",
  content: "I sing the body electric,\nThe arm tones'd in me rhythmic resting,\nThe hand and all its parts answering;\nI give the body no end, insistently spreading\nAlways a knelt suggestion, or two, or three,\nOr more, as it were, to be considered.\n\nLet us say there is no death.\nNothing but all succulent and fertile life."
